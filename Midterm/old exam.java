old exam
int sumArray( int[] num) {
    int sum=0;
    for (int i=0; i< num.length; i++) {
        sum+=num[i];
    }
    return sum;
}



Q9. What will be the value of x after the following statements are executed?
int x = 10;
for (int y = 5; y < 20; y +=5)
x += y;

4, should be 40


16. What would be the result after the following code is executed?
int[] numbers = {50, 10, 15, 20, 25, 100, 30};
int value = 0;
for (int i = 1; i < numbers.length; i++)
value += numbers[i];

The value variable will contain the sum of all the values in the numbers array.
